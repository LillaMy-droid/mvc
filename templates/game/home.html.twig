               <p><bold>Rules</bold>Each card is worth its corresponding number. Aces are either 1 or 14 points.
                    Jacks, Kings, and Queens are worth 11, 12, and 13 points respectively.
                    The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
                    If a player exceeds 21 points, the opponent automatically wins.
                    The player receives two cards and then chooses whether to draw another card or stop.
                    This continues until the player is satisfied. Then it's the bank's turn.
                    The one closest to 21 points wins the game. If it's a tie, the bank wins. </p>
